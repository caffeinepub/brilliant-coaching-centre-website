## Summary
**Goal:** Create a comprehensive testimonials page displaying current student and alumni reviews with a review submission form.

**Planned changes:**
- Add new Testimonials component with bilingual page title "What Our Students Say" and introduction text
- Create Current Students Reviews section displaying three student testimonials (Riya Sen, Anirban Das, Priya Roy) with grid/carousel layout
- Create Alumni Feedback section displaying three alumni testimonials (Arjun Mukherjee, Sneha Chakraborty, Rohan Ghosh) with differentiated styling
- Update existing SubmitReview component with new header "Share Your Experience!", subtitle, and confirmation message
- Integrate Testimonials component into App.tsx between TeachersNotes and SubmitReview sections
- Ensure all testimonials content supports bilingual switching (English/Bengali)

**User-visible outcome:** Users can view current student and alumni testimonials in a visually appealing layout, and submit their own reviews through an updated form with better guidance text.
