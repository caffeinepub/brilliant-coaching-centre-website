  "summary": "The diff shows that all three requirements have been implemented. The Teachers.tsx component now references 'santanu-sir-uploaded.dim_400x400.jpg' for Santanu Sir's avatar. The TeachersNotes.tsx component also references the same image path for the '4-12' tab corresponding to Santanu Sir. The file summaries confirm both components display the newly uploaded photo. However, the actual image file addition is not visible in the diff (only text files shown), so REQ-85 cannot be fully verified from the provided diff.",
