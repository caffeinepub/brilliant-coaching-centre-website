REQ-76 is satisfied by referencing the asset path '/assets/generated/brilliant-logo.dim_512x512.jpg' in the Hero component, though the actual file creation in the filesystem is not visible in the diff (which only shows code changes, not binary asset additions).",

The diff summary shows 0 added files, which suggests the binary image file itself may not have been committed or is not visible in this diff format.",
