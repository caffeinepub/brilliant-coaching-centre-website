However, REQ-89 is missing - there is no evidence that the image file 'image (2)-5.jpg' was actually added to the frontend/public/assets/generated directory. The diff shows no added files, and the components reference a renamed version ('santanu-sir-new.dim_400x400.jpg') rather than the original filename.",
