The frontend includes a complete SubmitReview component with bilingual support, form validation, star rating, toast notifications, and proper styling. The backend implements review storage with stable maps including all required fields. The component is correctly integrated into App.tsx between Gallery and AdmissionForm sections. All acceptance criteria appear to be met based on the diff evidence.",
