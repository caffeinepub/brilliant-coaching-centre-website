  "summary": "The diff shows that the Teachers component has been updated to reference new image paths for all three teacher profiles (Sonali Ma'am, Abhijit Da, and Santanu Sir). The images are correctly pointed to '/assets/generated/sonali-maam-photo.dim_400x400.png', '/assets/generated/abhijit-da-photo.dim_400x400.png', and '/assets/generated/santanu-sir-photo.dim_400x400.png'. However, there is no evidence in the diff that these image files were actually added to the frontend/public/assets/generated directory. The ADDED FILES section shows 'none', which means the actual image assets are missing from the implementation.",
