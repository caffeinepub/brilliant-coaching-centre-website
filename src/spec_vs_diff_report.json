A new Testimonials component was created with bilingual support, current students and alumni sections with avatar images, and proper styling. The component was integrated into App.tsx. However, the SubmitReview component update (REQ-61) is not evidenced in the diff summary, and the component placement in App.tsx appears incorrect (Testimonials before Gallery instead of before SubmitReview).",

Tell us how Brilliant Coaching Centre has helped you grow and learn.', form fields (Full Name required, Class/Year required, Subject(s) Studied optional, Review textarea required, Rating 1-5 stars optional), Submit Review button, and confirmation message 'Thank you for your review! Your feedback helps us improve and inspire other students.' with bilingual support",
      "reason": "The diff does not show any modifications to the SubmitReview component. Only Testimonials.tsx was added and App.tsx was modified, but no evidence of SubmitReview.tsx being updated with the new header, subtitle, or success message.",
