  "summary": "The BuildRequest specified 'Retry previous deployment' with constraints to preserve all current features and maintain existing design. The diff shows modifications to backend/main.mo, frontend/src/App.tsx, frontend-file-summaries.txt, and project_state.json. Since the BuildRequest contains no specific requirements (explicitly stated as 'none'), there are no missing requirements. The changes appear to be infrastructure/deployment related modifications rather than new feature additions, consistent with a retry deployment scenario.",
